# Self-Driving Car Using YOLO and Computer Vision

### Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** for real-time object detection, along with **computer vision** techniques to create a self-driving car simulation. The system is designed to detect objects like pedestrians, vehicles, traffic signs, and lanes, enabling the car to navigate autonomously.

### Key Features
- **Real-time Object Detection** using YOLO to identify objects like cars, pedestrians, and traffic signs.
- **Lane Detection** to identify lanes and keep the vehicle centered.
- **Vehicle Control** to simulate steering and speed control based on detected objects and lanes.

### Technologies Used
- **YOLOv4** (for object detection)
- **OpenCV** (for image processing and video handling)
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (for machine learning models)
- **Python** (programming language)
- **NumPy** (for numerical operations)
- **Matplotlib** (for visualizing results)
